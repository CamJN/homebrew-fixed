# CamJN Fixed

This tap contains formula that I fixed or created. They are not all always maintained, I update them when I have need of them.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install CamJN/fixed/<formula>`

Or `brew tap CamJN/fixed` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "CamJN/fixed"
brew "<formula>"
```
